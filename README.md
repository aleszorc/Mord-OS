![Mord OS desktop & mobile](https://i.ibb.co/3rqmHcw/Mordos.png)

> Achieve unparalleled productivity without leaving your favorite browser.

## Key Features

Mord OS includes:

- **Notes:** Create (you guessed it) notes, save them, and edit them to your heart's content.
- **Files:** Sort (\*sigh\*) files and create new folders for the files you probably don't need.
- **Reads:** Catch up on the latest news from around the world.
- **Photos:** Photos that remind you that you're getting old are now just a click away.
- **Camera:** Take photos and save them for a later viewing in the Photo app.
- **Browser:** Explore the wonders of the World Wide Web.

## Technologies & Assets

Mord OS was built using the folowing technologies:

- **[React]**(https://reactjs.org/) & **[Create React App]**(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- **[TypeScript]**(https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **[Styled Components]**(https://styled-components.com/)
- **[React Router]**(https://reactrouter.com/)
- **[React Webcam]**(https://github.com/mozmorris/react-webcam)
- **[SWR]**(https://swr.vercel.app/)
- **[React-Draggable]**(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable)

## Additional Feature & Improvement Ideas

The following features and improvements could be implemented:

- Light/dark mode: This could easily be implemented using the existing custom theme scaffolding.
- Proper token-based authentication (JWT) using an external API: Authentication (i.e. logging in) is currently being mimicked (intentionally without the use of localStorage) and could be replaced with more realistic scenarios.
- (Global) state management: While React's Context gets the job done, third-party state management libraries could be used as the app grows in complexity.
- Improved mobile UI: Existing mobile compatibility could be further improved with gestures for a better UX.

## How to Use the App

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000(http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser and use borgoth@mordos.com/12bindthem as login credentials. Have fun - I certainly did creating it!
